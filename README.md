# Module 2 | Advance CSS : Portfolio

## Description: 
A start-up project to showcase the skills I learned as a student in our Week 2: Session.
By creating/building a portfolio page from the scratch using the application learned from Wk 1 to Wk2. There will have an additional properties and techniques applied on this website learned from the third party source. However, it is still relevant to the project scope for this learning period.

## Link of the deployed project:
Can be found: [Github Repo](https://github.com/maytiara?tab=repositories) or 
[Gitlab UWA Bootcamp - Module 2] (Comment section)

## Tools and Application use in this project:
Software      | Front-end Language
------------- | -------------
Adobe 
Illustrator   | 
VS Code       | Html5, CSS3

## Challenges:
 >> At first, you would think you are already on track with everything, but after planning out the visual look of your index page you are suddenly caught in a "brain fog moment". But during the process of building the website, there will have a code that won't work even how far you tried to search for a solution. Here are the following obstacles I noticed if you need instant support "it won't happen as you were working remotely" and lastly the time if you don't manage your time and allocate a big amount of time to the project "You're DONE/FINISH".  

  >> However, I didn't discourage myself on my first attempt, I keep telling myself your still a student, you're still learning. You choose this crazy path, so just keep going until you fully understand the code you use.

  >> Finally, I made it! Another late submission, but with full of confidence, that I did something right :-)
